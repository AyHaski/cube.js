Cube Cloud supports connecting to databases residing in publicly-inaccessible
VPCs. This includes connecting to more than one VPC as long as their IP ranges
have no overlap.

## AWS

| Region         | VPC ID         | CIDR |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---- |
| `ca-central-1` | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` |      |
| `eu-central-1` | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` |      |
| `eu-west-1`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` |      |
| `us-east-1`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` |      |
| `us-east-2`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` |      |
| `us-west-2`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` |      |

For customers with VPCs in AWS, we send a [VPC peering
request][aws-docs-vpc-peering] that must be accepted, either through the [AWS
Web Console][aws-console] or through their preferred infrastructure provider.

To accept the VPC peering request through the AWS Web Console, follow [the
instructions here][aws-docs-accept-vpc-peering]. In Step 5, ensure **Modify my
route tables now** is selected so that the necessary routes are created.
